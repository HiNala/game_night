# Flying Squirrel Flight Simulator

A 3D flight simulator game where you control a flying squirrel through a beautiful natural environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Flight Physics**: Experience gliding mechanics similar to real flying squirrels
- **3D Graphics**: Beautiful 3D environment with terrain, trees, and atmospheric effects
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-learn keyboard and mouse controls
- **Dynamic Camera**: Smooth camera system that follows your flight
- **Immersive Environment**: Navigate through forests, hills, and open landscapes

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Controls**:
   - **W/A/S/D**: Pitch and yaw control
   - **Mouse**: Look around / steering
   - **Space**: Glide boost
   - **Shift**: Dive for speed
   - **Esc**: Exit game

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Use thermals (updrafts) to gain altitude
   - Manage your glide ratio and speed
   - Avoid obstacles like trees and hills
   - Explore the vast 3D environment

## Game Physics

The game simulates realistic flying squirrel gliding:
- **Lift**: Generated by forward speed and wing surface
- **Drag**: Air resistance affects speed and maneuverability  
- **Gravity**: Constant downward force
- **Thermals**: Rising air currents provide lift

## Development

Built with:
- **Ursina Engine**: 3D graphics and game engine
- **Panda3D**: Underlying 3D rendering
- **NumPy**: Physics calculations
- **Noise**: Procedural terrain generation

## Future Enhancements

- Collectible items (nuts, fruits)
- Weather effects (wind, rain)
- Day/night cycle
- Multiple environments
- Multiplayer support
- VR compatibility
